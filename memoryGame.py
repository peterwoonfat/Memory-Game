# Memory Card Game
# Pairs of cards are randomly arranged across a grid. They are originally face up for player to see for a few seconds then turned face down
# and the player must find the matching pairs within the time limit - each matched pair gives 1 point.

# declare initialize class for card objects
# player can select up to 2 cards at once, stored in a list
# when card is selected it is turned face up until either matching pair found then it dissappears or unsuccessful match and both cards unselected
